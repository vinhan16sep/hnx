Their expansive menu is filled with spicy, delicious noodle and rice based meals and soups that arrive in huge portions. They also have summer rolls and dim sum of course. Most of the courses are available with seafood or without meat as well, while for drinks we recommend the lychee lemonade or rice vodka. Hanoi Xua’s first restaurant is at Nagyvárad Square, while their street-food style second unit is at Kálvin Square.';

Pho soups, bún soups, dim sums, noodle and rice dishes are all featured on the menu, as well as several sea fruit courses, and heavenly lychee lemonade. All portions are huge, and they do not cost too much, so if anywhere, here it is definitely worth to experiment with Eastern flavors. To begin with, we recommend rice vodka, and summer rolls.';
$lang['the_place_text_2'] = 'The smaller and simpler, street-food style version of the restaurant at Nagyvárad Square is impressive within its kind. Despite being a food bar, the appearance is also important, and although the most important item is the pho, we can also have bao, stir-fried meals, and meat-based courses here. They don’t hold back with the spices yet there’s no reason to be afraid of smelling like food after eating at Hanoi Xua Kalvin at Kálvin Square. We can finish our meal with a dessert (mochi, tapioca pudding), or with a Vietnamese coffee; the latter is a coffee that drips through the so-called Phin filter resulting in a chocolate flavored drink served with condensed milk.';
